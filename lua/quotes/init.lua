    -- Programming Craft
    "Talk is cheap. Show me the code. - Linus Torvalds",
    "Code never lies, comments sometimes do. - Ron Jeffries",

    "Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it's bad. - Cory House",
    "Make it work, make it right, make it fast. - Kent Beck",
    "Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares. - Robert C. Martin",

    -- Programming Humor
    "It's not a bug; it's an undocumented feature. - Anonymous",
    "Programming is like sex: one mistake and you have to support it for the rest of your life. - Michael Sinz",
    "There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses. - Bjarne Stroustrup",
    "Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live. - John Woods",
    
    -- Programming Philosophy
    "Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute. - Harold Abelson",
    "Sometimes it pays to stay in bed on Monday rather than spending the rest of the week debugging Monday's code. - Dan Salomon",
    "The best error message is the one that never shows up. - Thomas Fuchs",
    "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow. - Linus Torvalds",
